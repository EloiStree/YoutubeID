hello everybody and welcome to this

video today I want to present you the Z

MIDI basically it's a stereoscopic

camera that allow you if you merge it

with the oculus at the back back to do

crazy project so this video is just

telling about the research and the

result I've done basically stills could

be run during and as you can see if you

cross your eyes

it's crazy it's precise you can really

feel the object touch it have a feeling

of reality

now you can feed your hand you can do

crazy stuff like serving you a tea you

know - hot stuff and the precision is so

good that I'm trusting - it's based on

the telescopic image and give you a 3d

model in real time that is not based on

infrared so you can scan outside you can

just can't really model that is metal

one so it's perfect to scan any objects

so I was wondering can I scan a shoes or

small objects and yes it does but mainly

it will scan a room so my second

question was okay can i scan the room

and in a how many time and as you can

see it's kind of perfect for kangaroo

because it take less than a minute and

you have the shape the volume and the 3d

mesh at the end you can record it with

the texture if you want you can record

it raw if you want and you can choose

the precision if you want something

better or 20 centimeter so for example

for this chair it was a bit better than

the small objects you have the shape you

have the texture

all you need to be able to do a tweety

bowl a little bit so i detroy know so

small object check if it is me who is

carrying badly but as you can see yeah

it's perfect to scan just the idea of

the objects but I don't think I will be

able to scan a small object with this

kind of device maybe we'll try my other

try was to scan myself because I really

want to be able to scan the size of the

guy in a quick manner Oh at least to be

able to scan the body and animate it but

it was a fail again but I think it's

just a matter of time for this one

because it's perfect so I was like okay

I will try to scan outside to see the

distant I can scan and as you can see I

have bike and if you wonder am I crazy

no I'm not because indeed it's still

here scope in camera and so what you

don't understand is that when you are on

the bike with this kind of camera you

really are on a bike like in reality so

I feel the deep I feel the distance and

it's impossible for me to fall off the

bike as you can see it's kind of crazy

the perfection you can have because here

I did ask the scanning to be 20

centimeter and as you can see I can scan

a street in less than 2 minutes just

walking in the street and bam I has a 3d

model of it so during my test that it

try lots of objects like your by bike

like the wall and stuff like this

and it works each time good but not good

enough to do a 3d model of it so you

really need to edit it the good part is

that you can scan just watch some object

and recalled the environment and then

asked to do the 3d rendering when you

are back home for example here I did

recall just the church and a guy and at

the home I was doing the 3d model as you

can see it's were kind of better than my

first test with the guy but he was

moving and so the 3d model is kind of

true but yeah it work well so people

have interests they ask a lot of

question about it and they are not

afraid of you running in the street with

a bike and a lot of equipment on your

face I suppose that they are used to

Google's

so here is the model in unity of the 3d

scanner as you can see it's kind of good

for the time I scan because ten seconds

scanning here and as you can see for the

road the scan is kind of super cool

because the 3d model is not totally

completed but at least the proportion

and the measurement are perfect because

if there is mixed reality positional

tracking that is working really really

well also I meet me I meet some people

on the road and as you can see they were

a bit surprised ninety and so yeah I

will try a lot of experiment like doing

the dishes and playing BR and doing

crazy stuff so don't hesitate to ask

questions participate to propose me some

experiments you would like me to try

with the equipment and ask any question

in the commentary I will be glad and so

yeah have a nice day

feel free to contact me and I will see

you later bye if you want to be aware of

what I'm doing and the news don't

hesitate to become a patreon and stay

crazy please stay crazy

you
