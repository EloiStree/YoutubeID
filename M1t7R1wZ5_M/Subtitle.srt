00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,920
hello everybody and welcome to this

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,140
video today I want to present you the Z

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,259
MIDI basically it's a stereoscopic

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,570
camera that allow you if you merge it

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,340
with the oculus at the back back to do

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,460
crazy project so this video is just

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,859
telling about the research and the

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,189
result I've done basically stills could

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,020
be run during and as you can see if you

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,010
cross your eyes

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,289
it's crazy it's precise you can really

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,990
feel the object touch it have a feeling

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,920
of reality

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,890
now you can feed your hand you can do

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,350
crazy stuff like serving you a tea you

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,170
know - hot stuff and the precision is so

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,010
good that I'm trusting - it's based on

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,010
the telescopic image and give you a 3d

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,300
model in real time that is not based on

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,149
infrared so you can scan outside you can

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,670
just can't really model that is metal

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,730
one so it's perfect to scan any objects

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,120
so I was wondering can I scan a shoes or

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,500
small objects and yes it does but mainly

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,810
it will scan a room so my second

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,030
question was okay can i scan the room

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,100
and in a how many time and as you can

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,170
see it's kind of perfect for kangaroo

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,880
because it take less than a minute and

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,770
you have the shape the volume and the 3d

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,040
mesh at the end you can record it with

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,080
the texture if you want you can record

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,080
it raw if you want and you can choose

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,580
the precision if you want something

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,150
better or 20 centimeter so for example

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,400
for this chair it was a bit better than

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,040
the small objects you have the shape you

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,729
have the texture

39
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,590
all you need to be able to do a tweety

40
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,710
bowl a little bit so i detroy know so

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,890
small object check if it is me who is

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,820
carrying badly but as you can see yeah

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
it's perfect to scan just the idea of

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,829
the objects but I don't think I will be

45
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,270
able to scan a small object with this

46
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,229
kind of device maybe we'll try my other

47
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,149
try was to scan myself because I really

48
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,890
want to be able to scan the size of the

49
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,390
guy in a quick manner Oh at least to be

50
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,119
able to scan the body and animate it but

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,520
it was a fail again but I think it's

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,050
just a matter of time for this one

53
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,290
because it's perfect so I was like okay

54
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,750
I will try to scan outside to see the

55
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,879
distant I can scan and as you can see I

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,110
have bike and if you wonder am I crazy

57
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,989
no I'm not because indeed it's still

58
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:29,640
here scope in camera and so what you

59
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,099
don't understand is that when you are on

60
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,410
the bike with this kind of camera you

61
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,930
really are on a bike like in reality so

62
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,349
I feel the deep I feel the distance and

63
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,510
it's impossible for me to fall off the

64
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,959
bike as you can see it's kind of crazy

65
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,060
the perfection you can have because here

66
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,510
I did ask the scanning to be 20

67
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,580
centimeter and as you can see I can scan

68
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,760
a street in less than 2 minutes just

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,980
walking in the street and bam I has a 3d

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,040
model of it so during my test that it

71
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,959
try lots of objects like your by bike

72
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,790
like the wall and stuff like this

73
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,120
and it works each time good but not good

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,250
enough to do a 3d model of it so you

75
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,800
really need to edit it the good part is

76
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,730
that you can scan just watch some object

77
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,620
and recalled the environment and then

78
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,420
asked to do the 3d rendering when you

79
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,900
are back home for example here I did

80
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,580
recall just the church and a guy and at

81
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,549
the home I was doing the 3d model as you

82
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,799
can see it's were kind of better than my

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,989
first test with the guy but he was

84
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,450
moving and so the 3d model is kind of

85
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,450
true but yeah it work well so people

86
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,920
have interests they ask a lot of

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,569
question about it and they are not

88
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,330
afraid of you running in the street with

89
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,489
a bike and a lot of equipment on your

90
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,140
face I suppose that they are used to

91
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,599
Google's

92
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,700
so here is the model in unity of the 3d

93
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,269
scanner as you can see it's kind of good

94
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:02,519
for the time I scan because ten seconds

95
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,280
scanning here and as you can see for the

96
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,650
road the scan is kind of super cool

97
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,769
because the 3d model is not totally

98
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,590
completed but at least the proportion

99
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,660
and the measurement are perfect because

100
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,108
if there is mixed reality positional

101
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,060
tracking that is working really really

102
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,540
well also I meet me I meet some people

103
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,550
on the road and as you can see they were

104
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,600
a bit surprised ninety and so yeah I

105
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,760
will try a lot of experiment like doing

106
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,810
the dishes and playing BR and doing

107
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,540
crazy stuff so don't hesitate to ask

108
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,020
questions participate to propose me some

109
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,729
experiments you would like me to try

110
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,030
with the equipment and ask any question

111
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,479
in the commentary I will be glad and so

112
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,060
yeah have a nice day

113
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,960
feel free to contact me and I will see

114
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,919
you later bye if you want to be aware of

115
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,750
what I'm doing and the news don't

116
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,900
hesitate to become a patreon and stay

117
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,090
crazy please stay crazy

118
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,340
you
